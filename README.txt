Cave Terror Python Game

By: Jack Loomis
********************************

Instructions:

- You must have Python installed in order to run the game.
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ in order to download the latest version.

- I created the game with Python 3. It SHOULD be backwards compatibile with 2.7 but I cannot guarantee.

- To run the game, open command prompt and navigate to where you saved the folder on your computer
	cd YOURPATH (e.g. cd Documents/Cave Terror)

- Once you're in the right directory, execute the command "python caveterror.py" without the quotes.

- Make sure that all of the files stay in the directory. If you move any of them, the game will not run.

- Unfortunately, the game is not a .exe so you cannot just double-click on the caveterror file to run the game. You
will have to run it with the above command from command prompt.

- Enjoy!
